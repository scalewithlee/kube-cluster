# kube-cluster

This repo contains code to create a Kubernetes cluster from scratch via Terraform.

I made this as part of the [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/tree/master) tutorial.

## Quickstart

Deploy:
```
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Destroy:
```
terraform destroy
```
